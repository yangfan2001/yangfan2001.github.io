Thesis in Computer Science\\n\\n#### Funding\\n\\nMy financial sponsor will be my brother, Wei Yang, and in addition, I have been awarded an annual scholarship of $4,000 from New York University.\\n\\n#### Career Object & Future Plan\\n\\nIn the immediate two years, I will be fully committed to pursuing my Master\'s degree in Computer Science at New York University\'s Tandon School of Engineering. During this time, I plan to specialize in front-end technologies, data visualization, and web development and production, areas that I believe are critical to the digital and technology landscape.My studies at NYU Tandon will provide a solid theoretical and practical foundation in these areas. I am particularly looking forward to the hands-on learning experiences that will allow me to apply the theories I learn in class to real-world problems, enhancing my problem-solving and technical skills.\\n\\nUpon completion of my studies in the United States, I intend to return to my home country, China, specifically to Shanghai, where I plan to seek opportunities in the tech industry. I am keen to work in an environment that is at the forefront of technological innovation, and Shanghai, being one of the technology hubs in China, is the ideal place for me to do so. In the short term, I see myself as a front-end developer, leveraging the skills and knowledge that I will have gained from my time at NYU Tandon. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to a company\u2019s success through creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and improving overall user experience. In the long term, I aspire to become a product manager. I believe that this role will allow me to use my technical knowledge and my understanding of user needs to oversee the overall design and control of software products. It is a role that requires strategic thinking, leadership, and a deep understanding of the technology market, all of which I am committed to developing throughout my career.\\n\\nI believe that this plan will allow me to contribute significantly to the technology industry in China, and I am eager to bring back the valuable knowledge and experiences I will gain from studying in the United States."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-01-27-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-27-welcome/index.md","title":"Hello World","description":"Hello World!","date":"2023-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 27, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"}],"readingTime":0.01,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Yang","title":"Fan Yang","url":"https://github.com/yangfan2001","imageURL":"https://github.com/yangfan2001.png","key":"fyang"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Hello World","authors":["fyang"],"tags":["hello"]},"prevItem":{"title":"\u5173\u4e8e23fall\u7533\u8bf7\u5b63\u7684\u603b\u7ed3","permalink":"/blog/\u603b\u7ed3"}},"content":"Hello World!"}]}')}}]);
